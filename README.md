virtual_obstacles
=================

This repository holds the virtual_obstcales packages for [ROS][1] [Turtlebots][2].
For more information see `package.xml` file. For license see `LICENSE`
and the sourcecode.

This package needs more documentation and more work to be generic usefull. I'll
try to add more documenation and modify the source to be more flexible, but don't
hold your breath. If you think it might be usefull just ask and I'll try to help.
